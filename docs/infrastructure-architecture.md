# 371GPT Infrastructure Architecture

This document explains how the Terraform infrastructure configuration maps to the overall 371GPT system architecture.

## Infrastructure Overview

The 371GPT infrastructure is designed to be deployed on OVH Cloud using Terraform. It provides the foundation for running the multi-agent AI orchestration system with all its components.

## Components and Mapping

### 1. Network Layer (`network.tf`)

The network configuration establishes:
- Private network for secure internal communication
- Router for connecting services
- Security groups defining access rules

This layer maps to the **Infrastructure Layer** in the overall architecture, providing secure connectivity between all components.

### 2. Database Layer (`database.tf`)

The database configuration provisions:
- Supabase instance with vector database capabilities
- Persistent storage volumes
- Backup configurations

This maps to the data storage needs of the 371GPT system, including:
- Vector storage for agent knowledge
- Relational data for business operations
- Document storage for unstructured data

### 3. Storage Layer (`storage.tf`)

The storage configuration provisions:
- Object storage for models, datasets, and files
- Backup storage for system state
- Content repositories

This maps to the **Content Repository** aspect of the overall architecture, supporting the Pimcore digital asset management component.

### 4. Compute Resources

The main compute resources in the Terraform configuration provision the following services:

#### 371GPT Core (AI Orchestration)
- Hosts the CEO Orchestrator Agent
- Runs specialized sub-agents (Research, Development, Creative, Operations)
- Manages the agent communication framework
- Specifications: s1-8 instance (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)

#### XPipe Server (Data Pipelines)
- Handles knowledge ingestion from various sources
- Processes and transforms data for agent consumption
- Synchronizes data between business systems
- Specifications: s1-4 instance (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)

#### Kespa Service (Automation)
- Provides workflow automation for common tasks
- Handles scheduled operations and maintenance
- Manages resource optimization
- Specifications: s1-4 instance (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)

## Terraform Implementation Details

### Infrastructure as Code Principles

The Terraform configuration follows these principles:
- **Modularity**: Separating concerns by resource type
- **Variables**: Using variables for customization
- **Outputs**: Providing clear access information
- **Security**: Implementing least privilege access

### Resource Management Strategy

1. **Provisioning**: Resources are created in a specific order to ensure dependencies are met
2. **Configuration**: Each resource is configured with appropriate settings
3. **Connection**: Network relationships between resources are established
4. **Security**: Access controls are applied to all resources

## Integration Points

### Connecting to Business Applications

The infrastructure provisions resources that will connect to:
- **Odoo**: For business operations (CRM, project management, invoicing)
- **Pimcore**: For digital asset management and customer experience

The connection points are defined in the network and security configurations.

### API Gateway Integration

While RapidAPI is used in the overall architecture, the Terraform infrastructure focuses on the core systems. The RapidAPI integration occurs at the application level, not the infrastructure level.

## Scaling Considerations

The infrastructure is designed to support scaling in several ways:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances of each service
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading instance types for more power
- **Storage Expansion**: Increasing storage capacity as needed

## Deployment Phases

The infrastructure deployment aligns with the overall project phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Deploy core network infrastructure
- Provision database and storage resources
- Set up basic security configurations

### Phase 2: Integration
- Connect all services via internal network
- Establish secure external access points
- Configure backups and monitoring

### Phase 3: Expansion
- Scale resources based on performance metrics
- Add specialized instances for industry-specific needs
- Implement advanced security features

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, security groups, private networks
- **Access Control**: IAM policies, role-based access
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Audit logs, intrusion detection

## Maintenance and Operations

The Terraform configuration supports:
- **Updates**: Easy infrastructure updates with minimal downtime
- **Backups**: Automated backup procedures
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with monitoring systems
- **Disaster Recovery**: Ability to recreate infrastructure from code
